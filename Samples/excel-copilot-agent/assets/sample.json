Then, the user opens Copilot and opens the **Chart Analysis Agent**. Using natural language, the user asks Copilot to insert into the open worksheet a chart that plots the data of one column in a table against the data of another column. The user specifies the columns but doesn't have to use the precise column names in the table."
