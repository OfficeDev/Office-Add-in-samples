# Get OneDrive data using Microsoft Graph and MSAL.NET in an Office Add-in

Learn how to build a Microsoft Office Add-in that connects to Microsoft Graph, finds the first three workbooks stored in OneDrive for Business, fetches their filenames, and inserts the names into an Office document using Office.js.

## Features

Integrating data from online service providers increases the value and adoption of your add-ins. This code sample shows you how to connect your add-in to Microsoft Graph. Use this code sample to:

* Connect to Microsoft Graph from an Office Add-in.
* Use the MSAL.NET Library to implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework in an add-in.
* Use the OneDrive REST APIs from Microsoft Graph.
* Show a dialog using the Office UI namespace.
* Build an Add-in using ASP.NET MVC, MSAL 3.x.x for .NET, and Office.js.
* Use add-in commands in an add-in.

## Applies to

* Excel on Windows (one-time purchase and subscription)
* PowerPoint on Windows (one-time purchase and subscription)
* Word on Windows (one-time purchase and subscription)

## Prerequisites

To run this code sample, the following are required.

* Visual Studio 2019 or later.

* SQL Server Express (No longer automatically installed with recent versions of Visual Studio.)

* A Microsoft 365 account. You can get one if you qualify for a Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription through the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://aka.ms/m365devprogram); for details, see the [FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-faq#who-qualifies-for-a-microsoft-365-e5-developer-subscription-). Alternatively, you can [sign up for a 1-month free trial](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/try) or [purchase a Microsoft 365 plan](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/compare-all-microsoft-365-business-products-g).

* At least three Excel workbooks stored on OneDrive for Business in your Office 365 subscription.

* Office on Windows, Version 16.0.6769.2001 or higher.

* [Office Developer Tools](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/office-tools-vs.aspx)

* A Microsoft Azure Tenant. This add-in requires Azure Active Directory (AD). Azure AD provides identity services that applications use for authentication and authorization. A trial subscription can be acquired here: [Microsoft Azure](https://account.windowsazure.com/SignUp).

## Build and run the solution

### Configure the solution

1. In **Visual Studio**, choose the **Office-Add-in-Microsoft-Graph-ASPNETWeb** project. In **Properties**, ensure **SSL Enabled** is **True**. Verify that the **SSL URL** uses the same domain name and port number as those listed in the next step.

1. Register your application using the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com). **Log in with the identity of an administrator of your Office 365 tenancy to ensure that you are working in an Azure Active Directory that is associated with that tenancy.** To learn how to register your application, see [Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/auth-register-app-v2). Use the following settings:

    * REDIRECT URI: https://localhost:44301/AzureADAuth/Authorize
    * SUPPORTED ACCOUNT TYPES: "Accounts in this organizational directory only"
    * IMPLICIT GRANT: Do not enable any Implicit Grant options
    * API PERMISSIONS (Delegated permissions, not Application permissions): **Files.Read.All** and **User.Read**

    > Note: After you register your application, copy the **Application (client) ID** and the **Directory (tenant) ID** on the **Overview** blade of the App Registration in the Azure Management Portal. When you create the client secret on the **Certificates & secrets** blade, copy it too. 

1. In web.config, use the values that you copied in the previous step. Set **AAD:ClientID** to your client id, set **AAD:ClientSecret** to your client secret, and set **"AAD:O365TenantID"** to your tenant ID.

### Run the solution

1. Open the Visual Studio solution file. 
1. Right-click (or select and hold) **Office-Add-in-Microsoft-Graph-ASPNET** solution in **Solution Explorer** (not the project nodes), and then choose **Set startup projects**. Select the **Multiple startup projects** radio button. Make sure the project that ends with "Web" is listed first.
1. On the **Build** menu, select **Clean Solution**. When it finishes, open the **Build** menu again and select **Build Solution**.
1. In **Solution Explorer**, select the **Office-Add-in-Microsoft-Graph-ASPNET** project node (not the top solution node and not the project whose name ends in "Web").
1. In the **Properties** pane, open the **Start Document** drop down and choose one of the three options (Excel, Word, or PowerPoint).

    ![Choose the desired Office host application: Excel or PowerPoint or Word](images/SelectHost.JPG)

1. Press <kbd>F5</kbd>.
1. In the Office application, choose **Insert** > **Open Add-in** in the **OneDrive Files** group to open the task pane add-in.
1. The pages and buttons in the add-in are self-explanatory.
