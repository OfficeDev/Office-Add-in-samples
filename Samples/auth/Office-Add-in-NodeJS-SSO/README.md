# Office Add-in that supports Single Sign-on to Office, the Add-in, and Microsoft Graph

The `getAccessToken` API in Office.js enables users who are signed into Office to get access to an AAD-protected add-in and to Microsoft Graph without needing to sign-in again. 

There are two versions of the sample in this repo:

- In the **Begin** folder is the starting point for the SSO walkthrough at [Create a Node.js Office Add-in that uses single sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/develop/create-sso-office-add-ins-nodejs). Please follow the instructions in the article.
- In the **Complete** folder is the completed sample. To use this version, follow the instructions in [Create a Node.js Office Add-in that uses single sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/develop/create-sso-office-add-ins-nodejs), but with the following changes:
  - Substitute "Complete" for "Begin"
  - Skip the sections **Code the client-side** and **Code the server-side**

These samples are built on Node.JS, Express, and Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript (msal.js).

## Features

Integrating data from online service providers increases the value and adoption of your add-ins. This code sample shows you how to connect your add-in to Microsoft Graph. Use this code sample to:

* Build an add-in using Node.js, Express, msal.js, and Office.js
* Connect to Microsoft Graph from an Office Add-in
* Use the OneDrive REST APIs from Microsoft Graph
* Use the Express routes and middleware to implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework in an add-in
* See how to use the Single Sign-on (SSO) API
* See how an add-in can fall back to an interactive sign-in in scenarios where SSO is not available
* Use the msal.js library to implement a fallback authentication/authorization system that is invoked when Office SSO is not available
* Show a dialog using the Office UI namespace when Office SSO is not available
* Use add-in commands in an add-in

## Applies to

- Excel on Windows (subscription)
- PowerPoint on Windows (subscription)
- Word on Windows (subscription)

## Prerequisites

To run this code sample, the following are required:

* A code editor. We recommend Visual Studio Code which was used to create the sample.
* A Microsoft 365 account. To get one, join the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://aka.ms/devprogramsignup). This includes a free 1 year subscription to Microsoft 365. During the preview phase, the SSO requires Microsoft 365 (which includes the subscription version of Office).
* At least a few files and folders stored on OneDrive for Business in your Microsoft 365 subscription.
* A Microsoft Azure Tenant. This add-in requires Azure Active Directory (AD). Azure AD provides identity services that applications use for authentication and authorization. A trial subscription can be acquired here: [Microsoft Azure](https://account.windowsazure.com/SignUp).

## Security note

These samples send a hardcoded query parameter on the URL for the Microsoft Graph REST API. If you modify this code in a production add-in and any part of query parameter comes from user input, be sure that it is sanitized so that it cannot be used in a Response header injection attack.
