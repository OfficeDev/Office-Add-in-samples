# Report spam or phishing emails in Outlook

**Applies to**: Outlook on the web, Outlook on Windows (new and classic)

![A sample spam-reporting dialog.](./assets/readme/outlook-spam-processing-dialog.png)

## Summary

This sample showcases how to build an integrated spam-reporting solution that:

- Is easily discoverable in the Outlook client ribbon.
- Provides the user with a processing dialog to report an email.
- Facilitates saving a copy of the reported email to a file to submit it to your backend system for further processing.

To learn about key components of this sample, see [Implement an integrated spam-reporting add-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/spam-reporting).

## Applies to

- Outlook on the web
- [new Outlook on Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/office/656bb8d9-5a60-49b2-a98b-ba7822bc7627)
- classic Outlook on Windows starting in Version 2307 (Build 16626.10000)

## Prerequisites

- A Microsoft 365 subscription.

    > **Note**: If you don't have a Microsoft 365 subscription, you might qualify for a free developer subscription that's renewable for 90 days and comes configured with sample data. For details, see the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-faq#who-qualifies-for-a-microsoft-365-e5-developer-subscription-).

- (Optional) If you want to run the web server on localhost, install a recent version of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) on your computer. To check if you've already installed these tools, from a command prompt, run the following commands.

    ```console
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

- (Optional) If you want to run the sample with a [unified manifest for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/develop/json-manifest-overview) using GitHub as the web host, install the [Teams Toolkit command line interface (CLI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teams-toolkit-cli). From a command prompt, run the following command.

    ```console
    npm install -g @microsoft/teamsapp-cli
    ```

- (Optional) If you want to deploy the sample with the unified manifest for Microsoft 365 to Microsoft Azure, you'll need the following:
  - An Azure subscription.
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
  - [Teams Toolkit extension for Visual Studio Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/install-teams-toolkit).

## Run the sample

Run this sample with a [unified manifest for Microsoft 365](#run-with-the-unified-manifest-for-microsoft-365) or [add-in only manifest](#run-with-the-add-in-only-manifest). Use one of the following add-in file hosting options.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The spam-reporting sample with the unified manifest for Microsoft 365 is currently only supported in classic Outlook on Windows. To run the sample in Outlook on the web or the new Outlook on Windows, use the add-in only manifest.
>
> - To learn more about manifests, see [Office Add-ins manifest](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/develop/add-in-manifests).

### Run with the unified manifest for Microsoft 365

#### Use GitHub as the web host

The quickest way to run the sample is to use GitHub as the web host. However, you can't debug or change the source code. The add-in web files are served from this GitHub repository.

1. Download the **outlook-spam-reporting.zip** file from this sample to a folder on your computer.
1. Sideload the sample to Outlook by following the instructions in [Sideload with the Teams Toolkit CLI (command-line interface)](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-add-in-with-unified-manifest#sideload-with-the-teams-toolkit-cli-command-line-interface).
1. Follow the steps in [Try it out](#try-it-out) to test the sample.
1. To uninstall the add-in from Outlook, run the following command. Replace *{title ID}* with the add-in's title ID that was generated when you sideloaded the add-in.

    ```console
    teamsapp uninstall --mode title-id --title-id {title ID} --interactive false
    ```

#### Use localhost

If you prefer to host the web server on localhost, follow these steps.

1. Clone or download this repository.
1. From a command prompt, go to the root of the project folder **/samples/outlook-spam-reporting**.
1. Run the following commands.

    ```console
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

    This starts the web server on localhost and sideloads the **manifest.json** file to Outlook.

1. Follow the steps in [Try it out](#try-it-out) to test the sample.

    > **Tip**: To debug a spam-reporting add-in, see [Debug your event-based or spam-reporting Outlook add-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/debug-autolaunch).

1. To stop the web server and uninstall the add-in from Outlook, run the following command.

    ```console
    npm stop
    ```

#### Use Microsoft Azure

You can deploy this sample with the unified manifest to Microsoft Azure using the Teams Toolkit extension in Visual Studio Code.

1. In Visual Studio Code, go to the activity bar, then open the Teams Toolkit extension.
1. In the Accounts section of the Teams Toolkit pane, choose **Sign in to Azure**.
1. After you sign in, select a subscription under your account.
1. In the Development section of the Teams Toolkit pane, choose **Provision in the cloud**. Alternatively, open the command palette and choose **Teams: Provision in the cloud**.
1. Choose **Deploy to the cloud**. Alternatively, open the command palette and choose **Teams: Deploy to the cloud**.

Once the sample is successfully deployed, follow these steps.

1. Copy the endpoint of your new Azure deployment. Use one of the following methods.
    - In Visual Studio Code, select **View** > **Output** to open the Output window. Then, copy the endpoint for your new Azure deployment.
    - In the Azure portal, go to the new storage account. Then, choose **Data management** > **Static website** and copy the **Primary endpoint** value.
1. Open the **./webpack.config.js** file.
1. Change the `urlProd` constant to use the endpoint of your Azure deployment.
1. Save your change. Then, run the following command.

    ```console
    npm run build
    ```

    This generates a new **manifest.json** file in the **dist** folder of your project that will load the add-in resources from your storage account.
1. Run the following command.

    ```console
    npm run start:prod
    ```

    Classic Outlook on Windows starts and the **manifest.json** file is sideloaded from the **dist** folder.
1. Follow the steps in [Try it out](#try-it-out) to test the sample.
1. To stop the web server and uninstall the add-in from Outlook, run the following command.

    ```console
    npm run stop:prod
    ```

### Run with the add-in only manifest

#### Use GitHub as the web host

The quickest way to run the sample is to use GitHub as the web host. However, you can't debug or change the source code. The add-in web files are served from this GitHub repository.

1. Download the **manifest.xml** file from this sample to a folder on your computer.
1. Sideload the add-in only manifest in Outlook on the web or on Windows (new or classic) by following the manual instructions in [Sideload Outlook add-ins for testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/sideload-outlook-add-ins-for-testing#sideload-manually).
1. Follow the steps in [Try it out](#try-it-out) to test the sample.
1. To uninstall the add-in from Outlook, follow the instructions in [Remove a sideloaded add-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/sideload-outlook-add-ins-for-testing#remove-a-sideloaded-add-in).
