# Import templates in a Word document

## Version history

| Version  | Date | Comments |

## Run the sample

You can run this sample in Word on Windows, on Mac, or in a browser. The add-in web files are served from this repo on GitHub.

1. Download the **manifest.xml** file from this sample to a folder on your computer.
1. Sideload the add-in manifest in Word by following the appropriate instructions in the article [Sideload an Office Add-in for testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/test-debug-office-add-ins#sideload-an-office-add-in-for-testing).

### Try it out

Once the add-in is loaded, use the following steps to try out the functionality.

1. Open Word on Windows, on Mac, or in a browser.

1. To open the add-in task pane, go to the **Home** tab and choose **Show Task Pane**.

1. In the "Template" section of the add-in UI, select **Choose File**. Navigate to the location of your .docx file then open the file. The template is automatically applied to your document, replacing any preexisting content.

    For convenience, the resources folder of this project includes a *template example.docx* file.

1. In the document, update the text and other content.

## Run the sample from localhost

If you prefer to configure a web server and host the add-in's web files from your computer, use the following steps.

1. Install a recent version of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer. To verify if you've already installed these tools, run the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.

1. You need http-server to run the local web server. If you haven't installed this yet, run the following command.

    ```console
    npm install --global http-server
    ```

1. Use a tool such as openssl to generate a self-signed certificate that you can use for the web server. Move the cert.pem and key.pem files to the root folder for this sample.

1. From a command prompt, go to the root folder and run the following command.

    ```console
    http-server -S --cors . -p 3000
    ```

1. To reroute to localhost, run office-addin-https-reverse-proxy. If you haven't installed this, run the following command.

    ```console
    npm install --global office-addin-https-reverse-proxy
    ```

    To reroute, run the following in another command prompt.

    ```console
    office-addin-https-reverse-proxy --url http://localhost:3000
    ```

1. Sideload `manifest-localhost.xml` in Word by following the appropriate instructions in the article [Sideload an Office Add-in for testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/test-debug-office-add-ins#sideload-an-office-add-in-for-testing).
