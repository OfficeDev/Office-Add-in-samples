# Mail merge in an Excel add-in

<img src="./assets/thumbnail.png" width="800" alt="A workbook with mail merge add-in open.">

This sample sends emails from inside Excel using the Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK. You'll learn how to:

- Verify and validate data, such as email addresses.
- Send email with Microsoft Graph.
- Sign-in to Microsoft Graph to get proper permissions.

## How to run this sample

### Prerequisites

- Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
- Install the latest version of the [Office Add-ins Development Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msoffice.microsoft-office-add-in-debugger) into Visual Studio Code.
- Node.js (the latest LTS version). Visit the [Node.js site](https://nodejs.org/) to download and install the right version for your operating system. To verify if you've already installed these tools, run the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
- Microsoft Office connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription. You might qualify for a Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription through the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program), see [FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-faq#who-qualifies-for-a-microsoft-365-e5-developer-subscription-) for details. Alternatively, you can [sign up for a 1-month free trial](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/try?rtc=1) or [purchase a Microsoft 365 plan](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/buy/compare-all-microsoft-365-products).
  
### Run the add-in from the Office Add-ins Development Kit

1. Create a new project with the sample code.

   Open the Office Add-ins Development Kit extension and view samples in the **Sample gallery**. Select the **Create** button in the top-right corner of the sample page. The new project will open in a second Visual Studio Code window. Close the original VSC window.
   
1. Open the Office Add-ins Development Kit.
    
    Select the <img src="./assets/Icon_Office_Add-ins_Development_Kit.png" width="30" alt="The Office Add-ins Development Kit icon in the activity bar of Visual Studio Code."/> icon in the **Activity Bar** to open the extension.

1. Preview Your Office Add-in (F5).

    Select **Preview Your Office Add-in(F5)** to launch the add-in and debug the code. In the drop down menu, select the option **Desktop (Edge Chromium)**.

    <img src="./assets/devkit_preview.png" width="500" alt="The 'Preview your Office Add-in' option in the Office Add-ins Development Kit's task pane."/>

    The extension checks that the prerequisites are met before debugging starts. The terminal will alert you to any issues with your environment. After this process, the Excel desktop application launches and opens a new workbook with the sample add-in sideloaded. The add-in automatically opens as well.

    If this is the first time that you have sideloaded an Office Add-in on your computer (or the first time in over a month), you may be prompted to delete an old certificate and/or to install a new one. Agree to both prompts. The first run requires installing dependency of this project, which might take 2~3 minutes or longer. During this time, there might be a dialog pop up at the lower right of the VSC screen. You should not interact with this dialog before the Office application launched.

1. Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in.

    Once you are finished testing and debugging the add-in, select the <img src="./assets/Icon_Office_Add-ins_Development_Kit.png" width="30" alt="The Office Add-ins Development Kit icon in the activity bar of VSCode"/> icon and then select **Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in**. This closes the web server and removes the add-in from the registry and cache.


## Use the sample add-in

An Excel desktop application will be auto-launched and the Mail Merge add-in will be auto-run on the right task pane area. The sideload steps has been integrated into the process, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

Please follow the steps below:

1. If you have an application ID already, please ensure: 

    In [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) under **Identity > Applications > App registrations**: 
    - Navigate to **Redirect URI**, set the first drop-down to `Single-page application (SPA)` and its value to `https://localhost:3000/consent.html`.

    Otherwise, if you haven't registered a web application with the Azure Active Directory admin center, please follow the steps below:
    * Log into [Microsoft Entra admin center](
    https://aad.portal.azure.com) using a personal or business Microsoft account.
    * In the navigation, select **Identity > Applications > App registrations**.
    * Choose **New registration**. On the **App registrations** page, configure the values as follows: 
        - Set **Name** to `Office Add-in Graph Tutorial`.
        - Set **Supported account types** to **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**.
        - Under **Redirect URI**, set the first drop-down to `Single-page application (SPA)` and set the value to `
    https://localhost:3000/consent.html`.
    * Click **Register** and copy the value of the **Application (client) ID**.

2. In Visual Studio Code: edit the `taskpane.js` file and replace `YOUR_APP_ID_HERE` with the **Application Id** you got from the App Registration Portal. 
3. Create sample data, including valid email address (required) and other information.
4. Verify template and data. the To Line must contain the column name of the email address.
5. Send email, which will pop up a dialog to get the consent of Microsoft Graph. After sign-in, the email will be sent. <br><img src="./assets/mail.png" width="600" altText="A mail to be sent">

## Feature details

`./src/taskpane` contains all the main page rendering, mail merge code logic, and Graph consent process.

1. The `taskpane.html` file is the main page of this project. In our sample project, we use several `text-area` boxes and `buttons` to interact with the backend for data and commands.
2. The `taskpane.js` file contains the main code logic of this add-in:
- The `createSampleData()` function uses the Excel JavaScript API to interact with the workbook. It inserts a sample table named "InvoiceTable" and fills it with the necessary data (email addresses) and other information.
- Your add-in can `get authorization to Microsoft Graph data` by obtaining an access token from the Microsoft identity platform. Use either the Authorization Code flow or the Implicit flow just as you would in other web applications, but with one exception: The Microsoft identity platform doesn't allow its sign-in page to open in an iframe. When an Office Add-in is running in Office on the web, the task pane is an iframe. This means you'll need to open the sign-in page in a dialog box using the Office dialog API. This affects how you use authentication and authorization helper libraries. For more information, see [Authentication with the Office dialog API](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/develop/auth-with-office-dialog-api).

- In our project, we use the `DialogAPIAuthProvider` class to open the sign-in page and get consent for Graph, which contains two functions: `getAccessToken()` and `login()`.
    - `getAccessToken()` checks whether the token already exists.
    - `login()` constructs a URL for the Graph login dialog and uses the Office JavaScript API to display this dialog. It sets up event handlers for dialog events. If the dialog sends a message with a status of 'success', it stores the received access token and resolves the Promise with it.

- The `sendEmail()` function replaces the column names in the to/subject/content text areas with the corresponding values in the table and sends emails row by row.
    
    The code for sending an email via `Microsoft Graph` is as follows:
    ```
    const sendMail = 
    {
        message: {
            subject: finalSubject,
            body: {
                contentType: 'Text',
                content: finalContent
            },
            toRecipients: [{
                emailAddress: {
                    address: addressValue[i][0]
                }
            }]
        }
    };

    await graphClient.api('me/SendMail')
        .post(sendMail);
    ```
