# Run the add-in from the Office Add-ins Development Kit
   
1. Open the Office Add-ins Development Kit.
    
    Select the <img src="./assets/Icon_Office_Add-ins_Development_Kit.png" width="30" alt="Office Add-ins Development Kit"/> icon in the **Activity Bar** to open the extension.

1. Preview Your Office Add-in (F5).

    Select **Preview Your Office Add-in(F5)** to launch the add-in and debug the code. In the drop down menu, select the option **Desktop (Edge Chromium)**.

    The extension checks that the prerequisites are met before debugging starts. The terminal will alert you to any issues with your environment. After this process, the Word desktop application launches and opens a new workbook with the sample add-in sideloaded. The add-in automatically opens as well.

    If this is the first time that you have sideloaded an Office Add-in on your computer (or the first time in over a month), you may be prompted to delete an old certificate and/or to install a new one. Agree to both prompts. The first run requires installing dependency of this project, which might take 2~3 minutes or longer. During this time, there might be a dialog pop up at the lower right of the VSC screen. You should not interact with this dialog before the Office application launched.

1. Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in.

    Once you are finished testing and debugging the add-in, select the <img src="./assets/Icon_Office_Add-ins_Development_Kit.png" width="30" alt="The Office Add-ins Development Kit icon in the activity bar of VSCode"/> icon and then select **Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in**. This closes the web server and removes the add-in from the registry and cache.

## Explore the add-in code
To explore an Office add-in project, you can start with the key files listed below.

- The `./manifest.xml` file in the root directory of the project defines the settings and capabilities of the add-in.  <br>You can check whether your manifest file is valid by selecting **Validate Manifest File** option from the Office Add-ins Development Kit.
- The `./src/taskpane/taskpane.html` file contains the HTML markup for the task pane.
- The `./src/taskpane/taskpane.css` file contains the CSS that's applied to content in the task pane.
- The `./src/taskpane/taskpane.js` file contains the Office JavaScript API code that facilitates interaction between the task pane and the Word application.

## Troubleshooting

If you have problems running the sample, take these steps.

- Close any open instances of Word.
- Close the previous web server started for the sample with the **Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in** Office Add-ins Development Kit extension option.
- Try running again.
