# Office Add-in First-run Experience Tutorial - Completed

## Summary

This sample is the result of completing the [Build an Office Add-in with a basic first-run experience](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/tutorials/first-run-experience-tutorial) tutorial. It's built from the [Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/develop/yeoman-generator-overview).

The tutorial gives step-by-step instructions on how to add functionality alongside explanations as to why code is being added. Use this sample if you want to explore and try the completed code, or if you need to debug any issues you encountered while following the tutorial.

## Features

This sample demonstrates the basics of implementing a first-run experience (FRE) in Excel. The pattern can be applied to other Office applications where Office Web Add-ins are supported.

## Applies to

- Excel on Windows
- Excel on Mac
- Excel on the web

The first-run experience pattern demonstrated in this sample can also be applied to the following Office applications. However, you won't be able to run this sample directly in these applications. See the [step-by-step tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/tutorials/first-run-experience-tutorial) for details.

- OneNote on the web
- Outlook
- PowerPoint
- Project on Windows
- Word

## Prerequisites

- Office connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription (including Office on the web).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest recommended version).
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) version 8 or greater.

## Run the sample

1. Fork and download this repo.

1. Go to the **Samples/tutorials/first-run-experience-tutorial/My Office Add-in** folder via the command line.

1. Run `npm install`.

1. Run `npm run build`.

1. Start the local web server and sideload your add-in.

    - To test your add-in in Excel, run the following command in the root directory of your project. This starts the local web server (if it's not already running) and opens Excel with your add-in loaded.

      - Windows: `npm start`
      - Mac: `npm run dev-server`

    - To test your add-in in Excel on the web, run the following command in the root directory of the `My Office Add-in` project. When you run this command, the local web server starts. Replace "{url}" with the URL of an Excel document on your OneDrive or a SharePoint library to which you have permissions.

      ```command line
      npm run start:web -- --document {url}
      ```

      The following are examples.

      - `npm run start:web -- --document https://contoso.sharepoint.com/:t:/g/EZGxP7ksiE5DuxvY638G798BpuhwluxCMfF1WZQj3VYhYQ?e=F4QM1R`
      - `npm run start:web -- --document https://1drv.ms/x/s!jkcH7spkM4EGgcZUgqthk4IK3NOypVw?e=Z6G1qp`
      - `npm run start:web -- --document https://contoso-my.sharepoint-df.com/:t:/p/user/EQda453DNTpFnl1bFPhOVR0BwlrzetbXvnaRYii2lDr_oQ?e=RSccmNP`

      > NOTE: If you are developing on a Mac, enclose the {url} in single quotation marks. Do not do this on Windows.

      If your add-in doesn't sideload in the document, manually sideload it by following the instructions in [Manually sideload add-ins to Office on the web](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing).

1. If the add-in task pane isn't already open in Excel, go to the Home tab and choose the **Show Task Pane** button in the ribbon to open it.

1. Verify that the list of Office Add-ins features is displayed. This indicates that the first-run experience was shown.

1. Close the task pane then reopen it. Verify that the task pane no longer displays the list of of features.

1. When you want to stop the local web server and uninstall the add-in, follow the applicable instructions:

    - To stop the server, run `npm stop`. This also uninstalls the add-in if it was automatically sideloaded.
    - If you manually sideloaded the add-in, see [Remove a sideloaded add-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing#remove-a-sideloaded-add-in).
