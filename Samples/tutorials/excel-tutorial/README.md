## Run the sample

1. Fork and download this repo.

1. Go to the **Samples/tutorials/excel-tutorial/My Office Add-in** folder via the command line.

1. Run `npm install`.

1. Run `npm run build`.

1. Start the local web server and sideload your add-in.

    - To test your add-in in Excel, run the following command in the root directory of your project. This starts the local web server (if it's not already running) and opens Excel with your add-in loaded.

      - Windows: `npm start`
      - Mac: `npm run dev-server`

    - To test your add-in in Excel on the web, run the following command in the root directory of the `My Office Add-in` project. When you run this command, the local web server starts. Replace "{url}" with the URL of an Excel document on your OneDrive or a SharePoint library to which you have permissions.

      ```command line
      npm run start:web -- --document {url}
      ```

      The following are examples.

      - `npm run start:web -- --document https://contoso.sharepoint.com/:t:/g/EZGxP7ksiE5DuxvY638G798BpuhwluxCMfF1WZQj3VYhYQ?e=F4QM1R`
      - `npm run start:web -- --document https://1drv.ms/x/s!jkcH7spkM4EGgcZUgqthk4IK3NOypVw?e=Z6G1qp`
      - `npm run start:web -- --document https://contoso-my.sharepoint-df.com/:t:/p/user/EQda453DNTpFnl1bFPhOVR0BwlrzetbXvnaRYii2lDr_oQ?e=RSccmNP`

      > NOTE: If you are developing on a Mac, enclose the {url} in single quotation marks. Do not do this on Windows.

      If your add-in doesn't sideload in the document, manually sideload it by following the instructions in [Manually sideload add-ins to Office on the web](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing).

1. If the add-in task pane isn't already open in Excel, go to the Home tab and choose the **Show Taskpane** button in the ribbon to open it.

1. Use the buttons in the task pane and the **Toggle Worksheet Protection** button to interact with the workbook through your add-in.
