# Run the add-in with Office Add-ins Development Kit extension

We recommend you try this sample by using the [Office Add-ins Development Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msoffice.microsoft-office-add-in-debugger). The Office Add-ins Development Kit is an end-to-end developer tool for building Office Add-ins. It helps create, run, and debug an Office Add-in.

1. Open the Office Add-ins Development Kit.
    
    Select the <img src="./assets/Icon_Office_Add-ins_Development_Kit.png" width="30" alt="Office Add-ins Development Kit"/> icon in the **Activity Bar** to open the extension.

1. Preview Your Office Add-in (F5).

    Select **Preview Your Office Add-in(F5)** to launch the add-in and debug the code. In the drop down menu, select the option **Desktop (Edge Chromium)**.

    The extension then checks that the prerequisites are met before debugging starts. Check the terminal for detailed information if there are issues with your environment. After this process, the Excel desktop application launches and opens a new workbook with the sample add-in.

1. Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in.

    Once you are finished testing and debugging the add-in, select the <img src="./assets/Icon_Office_Add-ins_Development_Kit.png" width="30" alt="The Office Add-ins Development Kit icon in the activity bar of VSCode"/> icon and then select **Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in**. This closes the web server and removes the add-in from the registry and cache.

## Explore the add-in code
To explore an Office add-in project, you can start with the key files listed below.

- The `./manifest.xml` file in the root directory of the project defines the settings and capabilities of the add-in.  <br>You can check whether your manifest file is valid by selecting **Validate Manifest File** option from the Office Add-ins Development Kit.
- The `./src/taskpane/taskpane.html` file contains the HTML markup for the task pane.
- The `./src/taskpane/taskpane.css` file contains the CSS that's applied to content in the task pane.
- The `./src/taskpane/taskpane.js` file contains the Office JavaScript API code that facilitates interaction between the task pane and the Excel application.

## Troubleshooting

If you have problems running the sample, take these steps.
