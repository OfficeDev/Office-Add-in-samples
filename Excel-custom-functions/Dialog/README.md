# Custom functions in Excel

Custom functions enable you to add new functions to Excel by defining those functions in JavaScript as part of an add-in. Users within Excel can access custom functions just as they would any native function in Excel, such as `SUM()`.  

This repository contains the source code used by the [Yo Office generator](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office) when you create a new custom functions project. You can also use this repository as a sample to base your own custom functions project from if you choose not to use the generator. For more detailed information about custom functions in Excel, see the [Custom functions overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/excel/custom-functions-overview) article in the Office Add-ins documentation or see the [additional resources](#additional-resources) section of this repository.

## Debugging custom functions

This template supports debugging custom functions from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). For more information see [Custom functions debugging](https://aka.ms/custom-functions-debug). For general information on debugging task panes and other Office Add-in parts, see [Test and debug Office Add-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/test-debug-office-add-ins).

## Questions and comments

We'd love to get your feedback about this sample. You can send your feedback to us in the *Issues* section of this repository.

Questions about Microsoft Office 365 development in general should be posted to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/office-js+API).  If your question is about the Office JavaScript APIs, make sure it's tagged with  [office-js].
