# Using storage to share data between UI-less custom functions and the task pane

If you need to share data values between your UI-less custom functions and the task pane, you can use the OfficeRuntime.storage object. UI-less custom functions and task do not share the same runtime and cannot access the same data. OfficeRuntime.storage saves simple key/value pairs that you can access from both UI-less custom functions and the task pane.

This sample accompanies the article section [Store and access data](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/excel/custom-functions-runtime#store-and-access-data)

## Applies to

- UI-less custom functions on Excel desktop and online.

**Note:** Shared runtime is now recommended for most custom functions scenarios. This sample applies to UI-less custom functions only.

## Prerequisites

To learn more about UI-less custom functions, see [Authentication for UI-less custom functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/excel/custom-functions-authentication). See [Custom Functions requirement sets](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/reference/requirement-sets/custom-functions-requirement-sets) for a list of the platforms that support custom functions.

## Sample: Sharing data between custom functions and the task pane

This sample code shows how to share data between UI-less custom functions and the task pane. The task pane allows the user to enter a key/value pair and save it to storage. Then in a UI-less custom function, the value can be retrieved using the `GETVALUE(key)` custom function. Or the user can use the `STOREVALUE(key,value)` custom function to store a value, and then retrieve it in the task pane.

## Run the sample

You can run this sample in Excel in a browser. The add-in web files are served from this repo on GitHub.

1. Download the **manifest.xml** file from this sample to a folder on your computer.
1. Open [Office on the web](https://office.live.com/).
1. Choose **Excel**, and then open a new document.
1. Open the **Insert** tab on the ribbon and choose **Office Add-ins**.
1. On the **Office Add-ins** dialog, select the **MY ADD-INS** tab, choose **Manage My Add-ins**, and then **Upload My Add-in**.
   ![The Office Add-ins dialog with a drop-down in the upper right reading "Manage my add-ins" and a drop-down below it with the option "Upload My Add-in"](../../Samples/images/office-add-ins-my-account.png)
1. Browse to the add-in manifest file, and then select **Upload**.
   ![The upload add-in dialog with buttons for browse, upload, and cancel.](../../Samples/images/upload-add-in.png)
1. Verify that the add-in loaded successfully. You will see a **Show Taskpane** button on the **Home** tab on the ribbon.

Once the add-in is loaded use the following steps to try out the functionality.

1. Open the task pane, and enter a value in the text box labeled **Send token to custom function**.
1. Choose **Send**.
1. In a cell, enter the following text to retrieve the value.

    ```
    =CONTOSO.GETVALUE("token")
    ```

1. When the cell is calculated you will see the value you entered from the task pane.

### How the custom functions work with storage

The /src/functions/functions.js file contains two custom functions named `StoreValue` and `GetValue`.

`StoreValue` takes a key and value from the user and stores them by calling the `OfficeRuntime.storage.setItem` method as shown in the following sample code.

```js
function StoreValue(key, value) {
  return OfficeRuntime.storage.setItem(key, value).then(function (result) {
      return "Success: Item with key '" + key + "' saved to storage.";
  }, function (error) {
      return "Error: Unable to save item with key '" + key + "' to storage. " + error;
  });
}
```

`GetValue` retrieves a value for a given key by calling the `OfficeRuntime.storage.getItem` method as shown in the following sample code.

```js
function GetValue(key) {
  return OfficeRuntime.storage.getItem(key);
}
```

### How the task pane works with storage

The /src/taskpane/taskpane.html has two JavaScript functions that are called from buttons on the UI. The `SendTokenToCustomFunction` function retrieves the key and token from text boxes on the task pane. Then it calls the `OfficeRuntime.storage.setItem` method to store the key/value pair as shown in the following sample code.

```js
function SendTokenToCustomFunction() {
  const token = document.getElementById('tokenTextBox').value;
  const tokenSendStatus = document.getElementById('tokenSendStatus');
  const key = "token";
  OfficeRuntime.storage.setItem(key, token).then(function () {
    tokenSendStatus.value = "Success: Item with key '" + key + "' saved to Storage.";
  }, function (error) {
    tokenSendStatus.value = "Error: Unable to save item with key '" + key + "' to Storage. " + error;
  });
}
```

The `ReceiveTokenFromCustomFunction` function retrieves the key from a text box on the task pane. Then it calls the `OfficeRuntime.storage.getItem` method to get value for the key and display it on the page.

```js
function ReceiveTokenFromCustomFunction() {
  const key = "token";
  const tokenSendStatus = document.getElementById('tokenSendStatus');
  OfficeRuntime.storage.getItem(key).then(function (result) {
    tokenSendStatus.value = "Success: Item with key '" + key + "' read from Storage.";
    document.getElementById('tokenTextBox2').value = result;
  }, function (error) {
    tokenSendStatus.value = "Error: Unable to read item with key '" + key + "' from Storage. " + error;
  });
}
```

## Run the sample from Localhost

If you prefer to host the web server for the sample on your computer, follow these steps:

1. You need http-server to run the local web server. If you haven't installed this yet you can do this with the following command:

    ```console
    npm install --global http-server
    ```

1. Use a tool such as openssl to generate a self-signed certificate that you can use for the web server. Move the cert.pem and key.pem files to the root folder for this sample.
1. From a command prompt, go to the root folder and run the following command:

    ```console
    http-server -S --cors . -p 3000
    ```

1. To reroute to localhost run office-addin-https-reverse-proxy. If you haven't installed this you can do this with the following command:

    ```console
    npm install --global office-addin-https-reverse-proxy
    ```

    To reroute run the following in another command prompt:

    ```console
    office-addin-https-reverse-proxy --url http://localhost:3000
    ```

1. Follow the steps in [Run the sample](#run-the-sample), but upload the `manifest-localhost.xml` file for step 6.
